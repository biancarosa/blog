Hi!

I'm Bianca and I'm a professional software developer since 2011 but my first lines of code happened around ~2003. Of course I had no idea of what I was doing, I was eleven years old and just wanted to ship a cool anime website without copying headers through every page (PHP includes did the job and I was happy with it).

I like writing elegant Python / Go code that is easy to understand and read within small teams. I like scalability and high quality software paired together with simplicity and readability. I know how to write code in a handful of programming languages and with my extensive experience in the industry and in systems architecture I can help a team regardless of its technical stack. 

I'm a backend engineer passionate by what's happening between the moment you hit send on a curl command to the moment you receive your answer from the web application that also likes to work on the infrastructure and take care of the software I ship to production. I believe infrastructure should be simple and easy to manage.
