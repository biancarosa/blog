I am not available *at all* for full time jobs at the moment.

I am, however, kicking off a [consulting company](https://behindtherequests.com/) and if you have a good project (short or long term) that you wanna talk about it involving Python, Go, backend, DevOps and/or platform engineering, I would love to chat. Email me at consulting @ biancarosa.com.br.

Also happy to speak about hourly rates for mentoring, technical presentations and short-term projects to help diagnosis what's the bottleneck making developers unproductive in an organization.
