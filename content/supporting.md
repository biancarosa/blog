Changing the world is a bold goal, but I am here for it. Even if its not a perceptive change. There's only so much change that an individual can make on their own, so I believe in the power of organized groups of people.

I do my best to support these organizations with *money*:

- https://benfeitoria.com/projeto/todasasletras
- https://associacao.python.org.br

And these projects with *volunteer work*:

- https://pyladies.com/ (globally, in Brazil and in Rio)
- http://pythonrio.python.org.br/

I'm also a believer of:
